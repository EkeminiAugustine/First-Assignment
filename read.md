    ## Introduction 

In a world of technological advancement and socio-economic growth, it was only a matter of time before the need of remote access to and control of activities arose.

Like every organization with foresight,  [Github](https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links) (a means to ease version control and tracking of software developments) was collectively founded in 2008 by **Chris Wanstrath**, **P.J. Hyett**, **Scott Chacon**, and **Tom Preston-Werner**. This company will later grow to be a universally accepted platform to connect professionals beyond borders, help recruiters find talented individuals and generally showcase the individual and collective efforts to the success of a project. 

## What is Github?

It is an online, cloud based, software development platform used by tech professionals to collaborate on software projects, store software data and keep track of changes made in real time. Github can be used as a social site by developers to connect with one another, as well as a free platform for developers to showcase their skills and talents.
